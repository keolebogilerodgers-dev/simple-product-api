# Simple Product API - Portfolio Project

A blueprint for a minimal, functional Web API built with **ASP.NET Core** and **C#**. This project demonstrates the core architecture of a .NET backend, showcasing planning, structure, and clean code.

## 📁 Project Structure & Contents
This repository contains the complete design and all essential code files for a working API:

| File/Folder | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| [`SimpleApi-Plan.md`](SimpleApi-Plan.md) | The complete project plan, objectives, and implementation steps. |
| [`Models/Product.cs`](Models/Product.cs) | The **Product model** - a C# class defining the data structure. |
| [`Controllers/ProductsController.cs`](Controllers/ProductsController.cs) | The **API Controller** - handles HTTP GET and POST requests. |
| [`Program.cs`](Program.cs) | The **application entry point** - configures and runs the web server. |

## 🎯 What This Project Demonstrates
- **Planning & Documentation**: A structured approach to software development.
- **C# & .NET Proficiency**: Creation of models, controllers, and application configuration.
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns (Models vs. Controllers).
- **Professional Presentation**: Clear, organized code intended for a technical portfolio.

## 🔗 Connect This to My Learning
This project is the direct result of analyzing Microsoft's professional eShop reference architecture. It represents my understanding of .NET fundamentals, translated into my own structured plan and code.

*This project is in the **design/planning phase**. The next step is implementation in a local development environment.*
